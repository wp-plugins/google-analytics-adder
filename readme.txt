###Why you should use Google Analytics

Ther are several options you can use to keep track of the visitors to your site a.k.a analytics.  All of the analytics programs have their advantages and disadvantages, including Google Analytics.  Google Analytic's advantages, though, outweigh its disadvantages.  For all around analytics, Google Analytics is your best option.

First, Google Analytics is free.  While there are other analytics software out there that are free, none give your as much data as Google Analytics with the ease of implementation.

Second, Google Analytics is fast.  You may not like all of what Google does, but one thing you have to agree on, Google knows how to make servers run fast.  And they didn't cut any corners when implementing the Google Analytics servers.

Next, Google Analytics is the standard when you want to sell your website.  Ask anyone who buys and sells websites and they will tell you that having Google Analytics data will bring you more money.  The longer the historical Google Analytics data, the better.
